# Football player detection and identification using OpenCV Haar Cascades

The aim of this little project is to detect and identify players from a team picture using the Haar Cascades from OpenCV.
It also includes an upscaling function in order to improve poor quality pictures and still be able to identify properly the players.

There are three notebooks: 
- two are the drafts and the tests of the player detector (face detection and recognition.ipynb) and the image upscale (test and comparison of ISR networks.ipynb). 
- the main function gathering both of the tasks and testing them. 

Additionnaly to Kyllian Mbappe, I tested it on Benjamin Pavard but can try with any of the 11 players in any team picture just by adding the reference image in the repository. 
NB: if you want to run the upscale function, be advised that it might take a few minutes.
