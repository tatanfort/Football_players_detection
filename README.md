# Ballin-test

There are three notebooks: 
- two are the drafts and the tests of the player detector (face detection and recognition.ipynb) and the image upscale (test and comparison of ISR networks.ipynb). 
- the main function gathering both of the tasks and testing them. 

Additionnaly to Kyllian Mbappe, I tested it on Benjamin Pavard but can try with any of the 11 players in any team picture just by adding it in the repository. 
NB: if you want to run the upscale function, be advised that it might take a few minutes.
